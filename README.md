# ShowMeMyMinions

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.2.0.

## Info
Personal project on angular 4 with a nodejs server that consumes the RIOT games API for the league of legends game.

## Use
The app allows you to check a bunch of data from your last played matches and compare it to the one of another league player in order to get a score and finally a winner.

## API key
The api key on the config file is deprecated so in order to test the app a new api key is needed.
